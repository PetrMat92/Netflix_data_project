# Movie Duration Analysis Code
This code is an analysis of movie durations from the popular streaming platform Netflix. The code utilizes Python and several libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualizations, and NumPy for mathematical functions.

# Prerequisites

Python 3

Pandas

Matplotlib

NumPy

# Running the Code
Download the CSV file named netflix_data.csv to your working directory.
Open the code in a Python environment or IDE.
Ensure that the prerequisite libraries are installed.
Run the code.

# Description of the Code
The code first creates a line plot of movie durations for the years 2011-2020 using the years and durations lists. It then reads in the CSV file as a Pandas DataFrame and subsets it to include only movies. A scatter plot is created with duration on the y-axis and year of release on the x-axis. The plot is colored by genre, with the colors representing different genres. The plot is then filtered to show only movies with a duration shorter than 60 minutes. Finally, a boolean variable is created indicating whether movies are getting shorter. The variable is printed to the console.

# Conclusion
This code provides a basic analysis of movie durations from Netflix. While it does not provide any conclusive evidence, it does provide some insight into movie duration trends on the platform.
